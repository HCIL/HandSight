*Pizza and Parenthood*
%Title: 1 Para: 6 6 12 0 9 1 108
I had everything I needed - the sweet sausage, the grilled shrimp, the three kinds of cheese. All my spices were lined up, the sauces in the right bowls. You could say I’d been getting ready to make this pizza for 20 years.

My father left the Catholic Church when he was 12. There’s not much Catholic left in me, except for my fondness for ritual. And so, as my wife and I have approached the date of the departure of our younger son for college, I thought long and hard about the proper way to mark the moment. We’d climb a nearby mountain, I thought, with the symbolic name of Tumbledown. We’d go out for lobsters and steamers. We’d head to the local Shakespeare theater and watch some Oscar Wilde.
But reality interceded. It rained the day we were going to hike Tumbledown; my boys decided they wanted to go out with their friends instead of to the theater; when I’d hoped to go to the lobster pound, my son needed to go shopping, and headed to the Maine Mall instead. And so, what with one thing and another, there wasn’t time for any of the sacraments I’d so carefully imagined.

Instead we ate pizza.
