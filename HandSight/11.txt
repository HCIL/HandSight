Despite the stubborn, widespread opinion that animals don’t feel emotions in the same way that humans do, many animals have been observed to demonstrate a capacity for joy. People have often seen animals evincing behavior that can only be taken to mean they are pleased with what life has brought them in that particular moment.
A chimpanzee named Nim was raised by a human family for the first year and a half of his life. After that time, Nim was separated from them for two and a half years. On the day that Nim was reunited with his human family, he smiled, shrieked, pounded the ground, and looked from one member of the family to the next. Still smiling and shrieking, Nim went around hugging each member of the family. He played with and groomed each member of the family for almost an hour before the family had to leave. People who were familiar with Nim’s behavior said they had never seen him smile for such a long period of time.
