Here's a tip. Don't stress over tipping. Restaurant tips are more modest in Europe than in America. In most places, 10 percent is a big tip. If your bucks talk at home, muzzle them on your travels. As a matter of principle, if not economy, the local price should prevail. Please believe me, tipping 15 percent or 20 percent in Europe is unnecessary, if not culturally ignorant.
Virtually anywhere in Europe, you can do as the Europeans do and if you're pleased with the service add a euro or two for each person in your party. In very touristy areas, some servers have noticed the American obsession with overtipping, and might hope for a Yankee-size tip. But the good news is that European servers and diners are far more laid-back about all this than we are.

The stakes are low, and it's no big deal if you choose the "wrong" amount. And note that tipping is an issue only at restaurants that have waiters and waitresses. If you order your food at a counter, don't tip.
