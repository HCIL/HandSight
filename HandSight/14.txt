There were teenagers who had forsaken Facebook and Instagram for the night, young parents determined to show their children the gossamer

National Moth Week, which runs through Sunday, was begun a few years ago by two naturalists in East Brunswick, N.J. It has since spread worldwide, aided by social media, with events like Moth Blitzes and Moth Balls registered this week in all 50 states and 42 countries.

Dave Moskowitz, one of the founders, began organizing moth nights in East Brunswick a decade ago with some like-minded residents.
