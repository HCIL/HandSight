Who doesn’t love a nap? For many, a nap is almost the best time of day. The world is sleep-deprived. Pressures at home and on the job are the reasons. About one-third of people report not getting enough sleep at night. A nap is the answer.

The normal sleep cycle lasts between 90 minutes to two hours. In that period, sleepers go through light to deep sleep phases. Deep sleep is the phase from which sleepers arise groggy.

The 10 to 20 minute light sleep power nap is best for getting back to work. That is as much time as most of us have for a nap. In a regular day, the best time is around one o’clock. In other words it can be done during lunch hour.

It takes longer to wake from 20 to 30 minute medium sleep naps. But workers perform even better after them.
