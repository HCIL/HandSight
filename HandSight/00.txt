Lemurs, which live only on the island nation of Madagascar, are long-tailed, long-legged primates with an astonishingly graceful leap. They are also in serious peril: Of the 103 species of lemur, 90 percent are endangered, critically endangered or threatened, and several are on the brink of extinction, according to the primatologist Patricia C. Wright of Stony Brook University.

Dr. Wright, 69, has long been a leader in the effort to prevent what she calls a “lemur holocaust”; in September, she will receive the $250,000 Indianapolis Prize for conservation; and she is featured in a new 3-D Imax documentary, “Island of Lemurs: Madagascar,” narrated by Morgan Freeman.

We spoke for two hours recently. Here is an edited and condensed version of the conversation.
