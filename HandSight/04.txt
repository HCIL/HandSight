Scientists counting Antarcticaâ€™s emperor penguins from space have found twice as many of them as expected. Using high-resolution satellite images to study each of 44 colonies around the coastline of Antarctica, experts said Friday that they put the total emperor penguin population at 595 thousand, or roughly double previous estimates of 270 thousand to 350 thousand. Seven of the colonies had never been seen before.

Satellite technology was a boon for researchers; visiting dozens of remote colonies in temperatures as low as minus 58 degrees is expensive, dangerous and time-consuming. With their distinctive black and white plumage, emperor penguins stand out against the snow, making them clearly visible on satellite images.
