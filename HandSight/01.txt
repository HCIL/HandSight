In the last 20 years, astronomers have found more than a thousand worlds exoplanets circling foreign stars. And they all have names only a mother robot could love. Some of them look or sound like caricatures of scientific notation, about as memorable as license plate numbers.

I need a cheat sheet to remember which of these planets are which, and why they matter. Kepler 7b, for example, is the "Styrofoam planet" discovered by NASA's Kepler spacecraft, a Jupiter-size world so puffy it would float.

A vast majority of stars - like secret agents - don't have names at all, only the numbers by which astronomers have laboriously listed them over the centuries. For example, HR 8799, which was seen by telescopes in Hawaii to have planets circling it like olives in a martini glass, is listed in the Yale Bright Star catalog, which was a successor to the Harvard Revised Photometry catalog, first published in 1884, thus the initials HR.
