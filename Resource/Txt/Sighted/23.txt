After 10 years and four billion miles, the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft will arrive at its destination on Wednesday for the first extended, close examination of a comet.

The last in a series of 10 thruster firings over the past few months will slow Rosetta to the pace of a person walking, about two miles per hour relative to the speed of its target at a distance of about 60 miles.

Photographs have already revealed a surprisingly irregular shape for the 2.5-mile-wide comet, possibly an amalgamation of two icy bodies or a result of uneven weathering during previous flybys. From a distance, the blurry blob initially looked somewhat like a rubber duck. As the details came into the focus, it now more resembles a knob of ginger flying through space.

Over the coming months, Rosetta and its comet, called C-G for short, will plunge together toward the sun. They are 334 million miles from the sun (more than three times as far out as Earth), traveling at 34,400 miles per hour.
