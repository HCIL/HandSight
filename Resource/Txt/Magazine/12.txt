In the 1800s, most geologists thought the sea floor was a lifeless expanse of mud, sediment, and the decaying remains of dead organisms. They thought that, with the exception of some volcanic islands, the bottom of the sea had no major geographic features, such as peaks or valleys.
In the mid-nineteenth century, ships depth- sounding the ocean floor with sonar for a transatlantic telegraph cable made some interesting discoveries. To geologistsâ€™ surprise, the ocean floor was found to be made up of long mountain ranges and deep valleys and troughs. Another surprise finding in the Atlantic was the existence of basalt, a volcanic rock thought only to exist in the Pacific Ocean. The presence of basalt in the Atlantic was a clue that volcanic activity occurs at the bottom of the sea. This and other discoveries, many of them accidental in the beginning, were signals to geologists that their knowledge of the sea floor was very limited.
