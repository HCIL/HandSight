Born in Spanish Harlem in the late 1950s, Raphael Sanchez learned at an early age to listen to the many voices of the city. It was as a boy in Harlem that he developed the powers of observation that would later make his writing truly great. In the 1970s, Raphael went to Columbia University, where he was exposed to a literary tradition. While his university education gave his writing new depth, the raw energy of the streets has always served as the primary fuel for his writing. This is what gives his works passion and power.

Raphael once told me that in order to escape from life he turns to books, and in order to escape from books he turns to life. It is this balance of the sights, sounds, and smells of the street with the perspective gained from his formal education that has made Raphael popular with both critics and regular readers alike.

For those of us who have read and admired his work, it seems natural that Raphael has won so many awards. He deserves them, and his humility in accepting them has been refreshing. When he received the Writer’s Quill Award two weeks ago, for example, he told the audience, “This award is not really mine. It belongs to all the million things that have inspired me.

”That is the kind of man I am introducing to you this evening. He is a man who has been inspired by a million things, and he is a man who has provided inspiration to a million people. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great honor to present to you, Raphael Sanchez.
