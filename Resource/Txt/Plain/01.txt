People have used coins as a means of exchange for thousands of years. Valued for their craftsmanship and purchasing power, coins have been collected in great numbers throughout history and buried for safekeeping. Because stores of coins gathered and hidden in this manner lie untouched for many years, they can reveal a great deal about a given culture.

Coins are useful in revealing many aspects of a culture. They can provide clues about when a given civilization was wealthy and when it was experiencing a depression. Wealthy nations tend to produce a greater number of coins made from richer materials. The distribution of coins can also reflect the boundaries of an empire and the trade relationships within it. Roman imperial gold coins found in India, indicate the Romans purchased goods from the East.

The way the coins themselves are decorated sometimes provides key information about a culture. Many coins are stamped with a wealth of useful historical evidence, including portraits of political leaders, important buildings and sculptures, mythological and religious figures, and useful dates. Some coins, such as many from ancient Greece, can be considered works of art themselves and reflect the artistic achievement of the civilization as a whole.

Information gathered from old coins by historians is most useful when placed alongside other historical documents, such as written accounts or data from archeological digs. Combined with these other pieces of information, coins can help historians reconstruct the details of lost civilizations.
